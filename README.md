Jane Street Real-Time Market Data Forecasting

Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a predictive model to forecast market responses using real-time financial data. The goal is to identify trading opportunities by predicting the "action" (whether to trade or not) based on anonymized market features. This repository contains the source code, data processing pipelines, and experimental notebooks for the DSC 288 Graduate Capstone Project.
